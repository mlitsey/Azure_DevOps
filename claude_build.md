# Example code from Claude. 

## Question:
could you write me a terraform file for azure, using a resource group called example with an ansible server, gitlab ce server, an aks cluster with a minimum of 1 node and a maximum of 10, using cert-manager with let's encrypt, keeping all passwords in a key vault, in a 10.0.0.0/16 subnet

### Answer:
I'll create a comprehensive Terraform configuration for Azure that includes all the specified components. Let's organize this into a well-structured Terraform file.

Azure Infrastructure with Ansible, GitLab CE, and AKS Cluster

This Terraform configuration creates a complete Azure environment with all your requested components:

1. **Resource Group**: Named "example" as requested
2. **Virtual Network**: With 10.0.0.0/16 address space
3. **Key Vault**: Stores all passwords securely
4. **Ansible Server**: Ubuntu VM with Ansible pre-installed
5. **GitLab CE Server**: Ubuntu VM with GitLab Community Edition
6. **AKS Cluster**:
    - Auto-scaling between 1-10 nodes
    - Connected to the VNet
    - System-assigned managed identity
7. **Cert-Manager with Let's Encrypt**:
    - Installed via Helm
    - Configured with production Let's Encrypt issuer
    - NGINX Ingress Controller for handling ingress resources

The configuration also includes:

- Network security groups
- Public IPs with DNS names
- Virtual machine configurations
- Password generation and secure storage in Key Vault
- Proper networking configuration

You'll need to replace the default `email_address` variable with your actual email for Let's Encrypt registration.

To use this configuration:

1. Save it to a file (e.g., `main.tf`)
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize
3. Run `terraform plan` to preview changes
4. Run `terraform apply` to create the infrastructure
